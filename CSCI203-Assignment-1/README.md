# CSCI203_Assignment 1

---

Given two unsorted arrays A and B. Array A consists of 𝑛 numbers of integers and array B consists of 𝑚 numbers of integers. <br>

The integers in array B are distinct and they are in the range 1⋯𝑛.<br>

The problem is to output the 𝐵[𝑖]𝑡ℎ smallest number in array 𝐴, for 1≤𝑖≤𝑚, and 𝑚≤𝑛.<br>

```
For example, let 𝐴=[7,3,8,21,5,11] and 𝐵=[3,5,1], then the output is [3,7,11]
because the sorted array of the elements in array A is [3,5,7,8,11,21] and
the first (1st) smallest element of array A is 3, the 3rd smallest element of array A is 7,
and the 5th smallest element of array A is 11.
```


Write two Java or C++ programs to implement the following algorithms

1. Algorithm 1. Sort array A and Array B and produce the required output
2. Write a report on the analysis of your implementation for Algorithm 1. 
3. How much time (number of operations) does Algorithm 1 take?
4. Algorithm 2. Sort array A but do not sort array B. Produce the required output
5. Write a report on the analysis of your implementation for Algorithm 2
6. How much time (number of operations) does Algorithm 2 take? 
7. Test run your program
